      Consider the following integral:$I(x)=\int_0^\infty \frac{t^{x-1}e^{-t}}{t+x}dt$. In the limit$x \to \infty$, find approximate behavior of the integral up to and including the leading order in $x$. Provide your answer in a $\boxed{}$ latex environment.
    solution: |
      $\boxed{I(x)\sim \frac{\Gamma(x)}{2x}}$

      Consider the following integral:$ \left|\frac{\int_0^\infty \frac{t^{x-1}}{t+x}e^{-t^{1/4}}dt}{\int_0^\infty t^{x-1}e^{-t^{1/4}}dt}\right|$In the limit$x \rightarrow \infty$, find approximate behavior of the integral up to and including the leading order in $x$. Provide your answer in a $\boxed{}$ latex environment.
