    the limit $t \to \infty$ Please provide your answer in LaTeX \boxed{} environment.
    Final answer should be in closed form and parsable. I don't want any self-defined
    constants other than e and \pi. I don't want to have any short-cut function you
    used throughout the solution in the final solution either. The solution should
    solely be a function of t.
